        <h4>A co-founder at one of the world's largest communities.</h4>
        <p>
          The combined experience I have working at the top Fortune 500
          companies has allowed me to develop a skillset that helps me in not
          just development, but in every aspect of any business.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm proud to announce that I am now working at one of the world's
          largest communities teaching young minds about how to sell yourself as
          a developer and open them to a whole new world of oppportunities.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          As a developer, you have everything available to you and all that's
          holding you back is yourself.
        </p>
        <p>A quote I live by perfectly illustrates what I mean.</p>
        <p>
          "How big would you dream, if you knew you wouldn't fail?" You've
          already gone through the hardest parts being a developer, it's time to
          elevate your skills and become a leader in something you're passionate
          about
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm happy to chat over coffee some time about how I can help your
          company
